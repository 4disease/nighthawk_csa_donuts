# CSA Ubuntu Deployment Guide

## Setting up Java runtime and development
Java is two pieces, we will need both if you want to run and build 
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
```
Install Java Runtime Environment
```
$ sudo apt install default-jre
$ java -version
```
Install Java Development Kit
```
$ sudo apt install default-jdk
$ javac -version
```

## Build and run project
Prerequisite is Maven install, as well as MongoDB and SQLite (above)
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install maven
$ mvn -version
```
Clone and build spring-idea repository
```
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csa.git
$ cd nighthawk_csa
$ ./mvnw package
```
Run and test you java project
```
$ cd
$ java -jar java -jar nighthawk_csa/target/csa-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Java service configuration
To run and start application automatically it will require a JAR file from previous step and a .service file that executes java. In this service file we are providing details the service: it should start after “network.target” has been started, ExecStart is the command that executes the service, currently this is running a JAR file. Create a 'service' file like the one below and place it in: /etc/systemd/system/<your_service_file>.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Java
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=pi
    Restart=always
    ExecStart=java -jar /home/pi/nighthawk_csa/nighthawk_csa/target/csa-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    
    [Install]
